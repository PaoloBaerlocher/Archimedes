This article references **Rotating3D** (displayed on the first page). This was a demo to test 3D rendering routines, later used in **Aldebaran**.

The article also references **BallsDemo** by Fabrice Mercier of the Arc Angels team (second page, top right corner).

These demos can be run from _Arculator_ (an Archimedes Emulator). They have been grouped in the [_PaoloDemos.adf_](/../../Demos/PaoloDemos.zip) file.

Note: _Armaniac_ was my nickname as a coder in the Arc Angels demo-maker team.
