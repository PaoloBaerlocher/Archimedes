This article references **Rotating3D** (displayed on the first page). This was a demo to test 3D rendering routines, later used in **Aldebaran**.

The article also references **BallsDemo** by Fabrice Mercier of the Arc Angels team (second page, top right corner).

# ARC ANGELS MEGADEMO

Some of my demos were integrated in the Arc Angels [Megademo](/../../Demos/MegaDemo.zip), in 1991.

** MegaDemo hub:** Door for launching a demo

** Vectoria Demo** (3D starfields)

** Army Demo** (2D parallax background + 3D animated object)
![Shots](screenshots/ArcAngelsMegaDemo/ArmyDemo.jpg)

**Note:** called 'Army Demo' because it was developed during my military service period (4 months).

**Note:** _Armaniac_ was my nickname as a coder in the Arc Angels demo-maker team.
